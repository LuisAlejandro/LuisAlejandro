(non-safe space alert: this description has sarcasm with comedic purposes). I just ruined the comedy part.

I worked as a ninja developer :nerd_face: at a famous govt-backed venezuelan GNU/Linux distro, now I'm retired (because of the huge profits) and doing [my own thing](https://collagelabs.org/). My passions: Python, Node.js, Docker, Crypto, being single, Aesthetics, Psychology, Joe Rogan, Star Wars, staying at home wanting to get out, etc.
