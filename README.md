(non-safe space alert: this description has sarcasm for comedic purposes).

I worked as a ninja developer :nerd_face: at a previously-famous govt-backed venezuelan GNU/Linux distro, now I'm retired (because of the huge profits) and doing [my own thing](https://collagelabs.org/). I have many, many possessions, but the ones I value the most are my passions: Python, Node.js, Docker, being single, Aesthetics, Psychology, Joe Rogan, Star Wars, staying at home wanting to get out, among many others.
